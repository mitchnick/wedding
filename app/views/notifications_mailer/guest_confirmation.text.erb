We are so excited you are able to make the wedding!!


On the website we have a list of some of our favorite things to do in Minneapolis.
We hope you have as much fun exploring Minnie as we've had over the years!

The website also has ceremony, reception, and hotel details. The preferred hotel is just
2 blocks from the reception, we highly recommend booking a room there if you are traveling
into the city.

Look forward to celebrating with you on July 25th!

Cheers,
Emily and Mitch
